### My Approach:

1. Firstly, I search in the internet for the symbol cipher.
2. Then I got this website [dcode](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.dcode.fr/symbols-ciphers&ved=2ahUKEwjy9uPh1oiGAxUw7DgGHTrqAIYQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3gB7rpKqcVe59q-sclOEha) a list of symbol cipher.
3. After that, I match the letter of my given cipher to the list and I got that it is `Pigpen cipher`.
4. Then I clicked it to decrypt and select serially as per in the image i got.
5. Then Boooommmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!
